# Cadence DJ

A simple application to help runners and cyclists achieve and maintain a desired cadence (steps/revolutions per minute) during their workouts.
The app will do the following once built:
- [ ] Fetch song recommendations for a given cadence/BPM.
- [ ] Allow users to create Spotify (and Apple Music?) playlists containing the recommended songs.
- [ ] Use `CMPedometer` to track cadence during a run and notify the runner if they are above or below the target cadence, within a desired tolerance.
  - [ ] If Apple APIs allow us to do this for cyclists, I will build that too.
- [ ] Provide an Apple Watch companion app that provides cadence notifications.
